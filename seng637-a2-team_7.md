# 1) Introduction

To increase our knowledge of software testing (and Java in particular), we are looking at JUnit testing. This is a common technique to test Java code using the built-in functionality. The JFreeChart .jar files were provided for this assignment and will be used as example classes for testing.

# 2) Detailed description of unit test strategy

### Overview

We're testing two classes:

- `Range`: Deals with numeric ranges.
- `DataUtilities`: Handles data set operations.

We'll use JUnit 4 for tests and jMock for mocking.

### Test Strategies

1. **Equivalence Class Testing**

   - Test different types of valid inputs as representatives of larger groups.
   - For `Range`: Positive, negative, and zero values.
   - For `DataUtilities`: Various dataset sizes and value types.

2. **Boundary Value Analysis**

   - Focus on the edge cases for inputs.
   - For `Range`: Test the exact start and end points.
   - For `DataUtilities`: Test with minimum and maximum size datasets.

3. **Robustness Testing**

   - Check how the system handles slightly out-of-range inputs.
   - Test `Range` and `DataUtilities` with inputs just outside expected ranges.

4. **Worst Case Testing**
   - Test with the most complex or extreme input scenarios.
   - Combine multiple operations or use extreme values.

### Mocking Strategy

- Use jMock for `Values2D` and `KeyedValues` in `DataUtilities`.
- Example:
  ```java
  Mockery context = new Mockery();
  final Values2D values = context.mock(Values2D.class);
  ```
- Note: Mocking focuses on method interactions, not full behavior.

### Test Case Development

- Write clear, single-purpose test cases.
- Name tests descriptively, e.g., `testPositiveRangeValues`, `testDataUtilitiesWithEmptyDataset`.

### Execution & Review

- Run tests against `jfreechart-1.0.19.zip`.
- Expect some failures due to intentional defects.
- Review and adjust tests as needed based on results.

# 3) Test cases developed

# 4) How the team work/effort was divided and managed

To let all group members gain experience with JUnit, each member was assigned a method from both classes. Once testing files were created, the other members reviewed the files to ensure all testing cases from the javadocs were fully tested. All information was then added to the report markdown file. Each member then did a write-up on how the class was tested to help describe their testing methodology.

# 5) Difficulties encountered, challenges overcome, and lessons learned

During the assignment we found that while everything was straightforward, it was tricky to get used to the structure of the JUnit tests. Once one or two were written though it was easy to replicate for the other conditions under test.

# 6) Comments/feedback on the lab itself

The lab was a good practice on testing using black box techniques and JUnit. It was fun to see how the tests failed.
